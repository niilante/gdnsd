// This header provides APIs for a basic control socket server.
// The underlying protocol is simple:
// 1. All data flow is serial client_request->server_response transactions;
//    there is no unprompted server-pushed output, and no new requests from
//    the client will be accepted until after the server response to the
//    previous request is buffered into the socket.
// 2. All messages are single chunks of binary data, with an implementation
//    defined maximum possible length of UINT32_MAX (~4GB).
// 3. Each request or response starts with a 4 byte unsigned length value in
//    native byte order.  Length zero is illegal in both directions.
// 4. Any communications error, or a length value from the client exceeding the
//    server's max_client_req parameter will result in immediate connection
//    termination and cleanup.

// * argv0 is the original argv[0] of gdnsd, intended to use for spawning a

// * Most errors are fatal, but in the special case that "csc" is NULL and we
// detect the socket is already locked by another daemon instance, this
// function returns NULL.
// * If csc_p is non-NULL, *csc_p must also be non-NULL, and we will attempt
// graceful takeover from the running daemon connected to *csc_p if the control
// socket lock is still held, and fall back to attempting non-takeover startup
// if it is not held.  Either way, either a valid "css" will be returned or
// this function will fail fatally.  If the csc connection was used for
// takeover, *csc will retain its original value.  If it was not used (we were
// able to obtain the lock normally), csc will be closed/deleted and *csc_p set
// to NULL.
