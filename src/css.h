// This header provides APIs for a basic control socket server.
// The underlying protocol is simple:
// 1. All data flow is serial client_request->server_response transactions;
//    there is no unprompted server-pushed output, and no new requests from
//    the client will be accepted until after the server response to the
//    previous request is buffered into the socket.
// 2. All messages are single chunks of binary data, with an implementation
//    defined maximum possible length of UINT32_MAX (~4GB).
// 3. Each request or response starts with a 4 byte unsigned length value in
//    native byte order.  Length zero is illegal in both directions.
// 4. Any communications error, or a length value from the client exceeding the
//    server's max_client_req parameter will result in immediate connection
//    termination and cleanup.
