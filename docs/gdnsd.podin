=head1 NAME

gdnsd - An authoritative DNS daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  Usage: gdnsd [-c @GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@] [-D] [-l] [-S] [-s] <action>
    -c - Configuration directory (default @GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@)
    -D - Enable verbose debug output
    -l - Send logs to syslog rather than stderr
    -S - Force 'zones_strict_data = true' for this invocation
    -s - Force 'zones_strict_startup = true' for this invocation
  Actions:
    checkconf - Checks validity of config and zone files
    start - Start as a regular foreground process
    daemonize - Start as a background daemon (implies -l)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gdnsd> is very fast, light, and pluggable authoritative DNS daemon.

=head1 BASIC CONFIGURATION

The primary configuration file is the file named F<config> in the
configuration directory.

Note that the configuration file does not have to exist for successful
startup.  Without a configuration file, gdnsd will load all of the zones
in the zones directory and listen on port 53 of C<0.0.0.0> and C<::>
using default settings.  It will also, by default, automatically process
changes (add/delete/update) to the set of zonefiles present in the zones
directory, which defaults to the F<zones/> subdirectory of the configuration
directory (C<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@/zones/>).

=head1 COMMANDLINE OPTION FLAGS

=over 4

=item B<-c>

Set the configuration directory, defaults to F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@>.

=item B<-D>

Enables additional debug-level log output as appropriate.

=item B<-l>

Sends log output to syslog rather than the default stderr.  This is implicitly
turned on by the C<daemonize> action, and is recommended when running as a
systemd service as well, to capture priority information.

=item B<-S>

Forces the C<zones_strict_data> configuration option to true for
this invocation, regardless of the setting in the config file.  This is
mostly useful for validation during the C<checkconf> option.

=item B<-s>

Forces the C<zones_strict_startup> configuration option to true for
this invocation, regardless of the setting in the config file.  This is
mostly useful for validation during the C<checkconf> option.

=back

=head1 ACTIONS

=over 4

=item B<checkconf>

Checks the validity of the configuration file and zonefiles, setting
the exit status appropriately (0 for success).  The same code executes
implicitly during startup; checkconf just exits at the last point
before real runtime actions need to be taken, such as acquiring
sockets.

=item B<start>

Starts gdnsd as a runtime DNS server foreground process, emitting log
output to stderr.

=item B<daemonize>

Starts gdnsd as a detached background daemonize process in a new
session, parented to PID 1 (init), emitting log output to directly to
syslog.  The initial foreground process will emit no terminal output on
success, but will wait for the background daemon to complete startup
operations successfully before exiting with status zero (or not, in
which case it will exit non-zero and emit some kind of failure output to
either stderr or syslog).

=back

Any other commandline option will be treated as invalid,
which will result in displaying a short help text to F<STDERR>
and exiting with a non-zero exit status.  This includes
things like the ubiquitous B<--help> and B<--version>.

=head1 PRIVILEGES

This service pays no attention to, nor does it attempt to check or
modify, anything about the runtime security environment or privelege
set, or whether or not it happens to be running as C<root>, or attempt
any actions that would commonly require C<root> priveleges, such as
altering its own memlock rlimits or raising its own process priority.
The lone exception is that the code blindly assumes that binding its DNS
listening ports, which default to being in the priveleged range, will
Just Work.

It expects all such things to be managed managed by external
mechanisms: either a systemd-like init system which can do it all
declaratively, or a combination of tooling in an initscript for a
traditional init system to take care of the necessary privileged
settings and/or security-jailing / ACLs, etc,

=head1 SYSTEMD COMPATIBILITY

When run as a systemd service, C<start> should be used rather than
C<daemonize>, the C<-l> flag should be used, and the type should be set
to C<Type=notify> with C<NotifyAccess=all>.  The latter bits will cause
systemd to set C<$NOTIFY_SOCKET> for the daemon, and the daemon in turn
will use this to send a readiness notification when it's done with
initial startup tasks and ready to service requests.  C<gdnsdctl -l stop>
should be used for the C<ExecStop=> command.

The source tree contains an example systemd unit file with reasonable
defaults for a production deployment.

=head1 ZONE FILES - RFC1035

The directory for standard RFC1035 zone files (the default
zone data backend) is the subdirectory named C<zones> in the
configuration directory, so the default would be
F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@/zones/>.

RFC1035 zone files are the traditional zone file format that
one typically uses with e.g. BIND.  For more information on
the internal format and processing of these files, see
L<gdnsd.zonefile(5)>.  This section is about how the directory
itself is managed.

All files in the zones directory are considered zone files.
In general there should be exactly one file per zone, and the
filename should match the zone name.  Filenames beginning with
C<.> are ignored.  All zone file must be regular files
(as opposed to directories, symlinks, sockets, etc).

By default, the zones directory is handled dynamically: as files
are added, modified, and deleted in this directory, zone data will
automatically update at runtime.  This feature can be disabled
(such that an explicit SIGUSR1 or C<gdnsd reload-zones> is required to
re-scan for changes) in the config file via the directive
C<zones_rfc1035_auto> (see L<gdnsd.config(5)>).  It is legal for
the directory to be empty at startup, which results in all queries
returning C<REFUSED>.

In order to better support the special case of RFC 2137 -style
classless in-addr.arpa delegation zones (which contain forward
slashes), any C<@> symbol in the filename will be translated
to a forward slash (C</>) when transforming a filename into
its corresponding zone name.

For similar reasons, if your server is intended to serve the
root of the DNS, the filename for the root zone should be
the special filename F<ROOT_ZONE>, rather than the impossible
literal filename F<.>.  Because authoritative servers cannot
serve two domains which have a parent<->child relationship
correctly, a root server cannot serve any other zone, so this
would be the sole zonefile.

The standard DNS zone file escape sequences are recognized within
the filenames (e.g. C<\.> for a dot within a label, or C<\NNN>
where NNN is a decimal integer in the range 0 - 255), if for some
reason you need a strange character in your zone name.

Trailing dots on zonefile names are ignored; e.g. F<example.com>
and F<example.com.> are functionally equivalent.

Duplicate zones (e.g. having both of the above representations of
C<example.com> present in the zones directory, and/or adding a
different case-mapping such as F<EXample.Com>) are handled by
loading both and giving runtime lookup priority to one of the copies
based on a couple of simple rules: the highest C<serial> wins,
and if more than one file has the highest serial, the highest
filesystem C<mtime> value wins.  If the primary copy is later
removed, any remaining copy of the zone will be promoted for
runtime lookups according to that same ordering.

Subzones (e.g. having zonefiles for both C<example.com> and
C<subz.example.com>) are only marginally supported.  The child zone
will be loaded into memory, but its data won't be available for
lookup, as it is suppressed by the existence of the parent zone.
If the parent zone is later removed, the subzone data will become
available.  Logically, it is not possible for a single server to
be authoritative for both a subzone and its parent zone at the
same time, as each "role" (parent and child) requires different
responses to requests for data within the child zone.  gdnsd
choses to default to the "parent" role in these conflict cases.

Tools which are used to update zonefiles while gdnsd is running should always
use atomic operations (C<rename()>, C<unlink()>, C<link()>) to alter the zone
files.  See the documentation for C<zones_rfc1035_quiesce> in
L<gdnsd.config(5)> for more details about this.

=head1 ZONE FILES - DJBDNS

There is now experimental support for djbdns-format zonefiles
in the F<djbdns> subdirectory of the config directory
(default F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@/djbdns/>.  For more information
see L<gdnsd.djbdns(5)>.

If the same zone is specified via more than one zone data backend
(e.g. rfc1035 + djbdns), the same rules shown in the above section
apply: both will be loaded and managed, but only one will be used
for queries at any given time (based on mtime/serial).

=head1 DIRECTORIES

Important directory paths for the core daemon code:

=over 4

=item F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_CONFIG@>

Default configuration directory, unless overridden via C<-c>.  The
primary configuration file is always the file F<config> in the
configuration directory.

=item F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_RUN@>

Default run_dir.  This is where the daemon's control socket and lock
files are created.  See the entry for C<run_dir> in the
L<gdnsd.config(5)> manpage for more information about this directory.

=item F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_STATE@>

Default state_dir.  The F<admin_state> file is read from this directory
for administrative state-overrides on monitored resources, see below
in the FILES section.  See the entry for C<state_dir> in the
L<gdnsd.config(5)> manpage for more information about this directory.

=item F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_LIB@>

This is the default path that plugin shared libraries are loaded from.
Other directories can be prepended to the search path via the configuration
option C<plugin_search_path>, documented in L<gdnsd.config(5)>.

=item F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_LIBEXEC@>

This is the default path for daemon-private executables that users should
not run.  The only current case is F<gdnsd_extmon_helper> for the
extmon plugin and the path for this can be overridden in that plugin's
configuration, documented in L<gdnsd-plugin-extmon(8)>.

=back

=head1 ADMIN STATE FILE - F<@GDNSD_DEFPATH_STATE@/admin_state>

This file is the input for administrative state overrides affecting plugin
resolution decisions.  The intent of this file is to allow explicit, human
administrative decisions to temporarily override the states affecting plugin
decision-making on issues of failover and/or geographic distribution.  A
non-existent file is treated the same as an empty file.  The file is watched
at runtime for changes, and any overridden state found is applied quickly.
The file is expected to persist reboots and daemon restarts in order to
preserve the administrator's intent through these events.

A basic understanding of how both monitoring and resolution plugins in gdnsd
work is assumed (see L<gdnsd.config(5)>).  This file is parsed as a vscf hash
data structure (again, see L<gdnsd.config(5)> for deeper details of that format).
The keys are the names of monitored or virtual resources, and the values are
forced state values (optionally with monitored-TTL values as well).  Keys
can also be wildcards using the shell glob syntax which affect multiple
resources.

For normal monitored resources, the typical form of a key would be
C<THING/service_type>, where C<THING> is the monitored address or CNAME value
and C<service_type> is the service_type configured to monitor that address
or CNAME value by one or more resolver plugins.  The value portion takes
the form of C<STATE[/TTL]>, where C<STATE> is C<UP> or C<DOWN> and the TTL
portion is an optional override of the monitored TTL.

The order of the lines in the file is important; they are processed and applied
in-order such that later lines can override the actions of earlier lines.  This
is especially handy for making exceptions to glob-matches.

Example:

    @GDNSD_DEFPATH_STATE@/admin_state:
        2001:db8::2:123/my_http_check => DOWN # down a specific res+stype
        foo.example.com./extmon_ping => UP # up a specific res+stype
        192.0.2.1/* => DOWN # down all service_types for this address
        */xmpp => UP/30 # up all resources monitored by xmpp w/ TTL 30 ...
        192.0.2.2/xmpp => DOWN # ... except this one

Some resolution plugins can also register virtual resources (which are not
monitored by any C<service_type>) solely for the purpose of administrative
override of decision-making.  Currently the geoip and metafo plugins do this
for their C<datacenters>, and the keys they create take the form of
C<plugin_name/resname/dcname> to force a datacenter's state at the
per-resource level.  The geoip plugin also supports keys of the form
C<plugin_name/mapname/dcname> to force a datacenter's state
at the per-map level.  These forcings override the aggregate state passed
up to geoip/metafo from per-datacenter plugins (e.g. multifo or weighted
monitoring several addresses in a datacenter), and in the geoip case
the more-specific per-resource forced state will override any per-map
forced state.

Example:

    @GDNSD_DEFPATH_STATE@/admin_state:
        geoip/map3/dc-us => DOWN # down dc-us in geoip map3
        */dc-jp => DOWN # down all datacenters named dc-jp for geoip and metafo
        metafo/res_www/dc-jp => UP # exception to above

All of the available monitored and virtual keys that can be matched in this
file are listed in the daemon's HTML, CSV, and JSON -format outputs from
the built-in status http server (default port 3506), as are their current
monitors and admin_state-forced states.

=head1 SIGNALS

Any signal not explicitly mentioned is not explicitly handled.  That
is to say, they will have their default actions, which often include
aborting execution.

=over 4

=item B<SIGTERM>, B<SIGINT>

Causes the daemon to exit gracefully with accompanying log output.  The exit
status will reflect the terminating signal appropriately.

=item B<SIGUSR1>

Causes the daemon to attempt to load any new changes to the zone data.

=item B<SIGPIPE>

Ignored.

=item B<SIGHUP>

If started via C<daemonize>, C<SIGHUP> is explicitly ignored by the
background daemon, but not by the temporary foreground process during
initialization.  When started via C<start>, C<SIGHUP> handling is left
at defaults, which will normally result in unclean process termination
on reception.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

An exit status of zero indicates success, anything else indicates
failure.

For C<daemonize>, the exit status of the initial foreground process will
indicate whether the background daemon launched successfully.

For C<start>, the initial foreground process B<is> the daemon, and exit
status will reflect the terminating signal appropriately even in a clean
shutdown case, or be zero if cleanly shut down by non-signal mechanisms.
